Train Scheduler using a Firebase database created by Cera Smart

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station, relative to the current time.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with jQuery and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught me how to work with Firebase and Moment.js.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT
